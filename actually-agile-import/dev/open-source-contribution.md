# Open-Source Contributions 

As developers, we consume and benefit from open-source software every day. To be socially responsible as software developers, we need to give back to the community that makes us so productive. 

## Champion

Byron Sommardahl - [Schedule](https://calendly.com/sommardahl/30min)

## Requirements:
- Evidence of one non-trivial contribution to a popular open-source software project (ex: code or documentation) that has been merged by the core team. 
- Acceptable evidence: Pull/Merge Request link
- Only one open-source contribution per month will be accepted

## What is considered a "popular" open-source project for this badge?
- A project with community around it (example: more than 50 stars in github)
- A project with issues and/or pull-requests from multiple people in the community
- An existing Acklen Avenue open-source project (boilerplates and libraries). (not exactly popular to the rest of the world, but they are to us!) 

If you would like to submit your personal project for this badge, you should get the approval as an official open-source project from a company like Jetbrains who will happily evaluate your project.

## Evaluation:
- Send evidence of open-source contribution to your mentor via email or slack. 
- Schedule a 30-minute discussion with your mentor to review your contribution together.

NOTE: Certification expires in 3 months, so keep this in mind as you are planning to complete a pathway that requires Open-Source Contributions.
